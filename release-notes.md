# Release notes

## Q4 2017

### December 2017
The IBM COS SDK for Python has been updated to 2.0.  This release primarily fixes an issue for users trying to connect to IBM COS and AWS services within the same application by changing the namespacing for the library from `boto3` to `ibm_boto3`.  For more infomation check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cos-sdk-python), the [API documentation](https://ibm.github.io/ibm-cos-sdk-python), or this [blog post](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/11/ibm-cloud-object-storage-enhancements-help-companies-better-manage-access-data-app-development-analytics/).
