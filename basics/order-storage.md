# Order storage

## Creating a new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Platform account

Before ordering a new {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} storage instance, it is necessary to create a customer account first.

1. Go to [bluemix.net][6]{: new_window} and click on the **Create a Free Account** button.
2. Fill out the form, providing your email address, name, region, and phone number.  Choose a password.
3. Follow the link provided by the confirmation email, and follow the links to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Platform.
4. Before using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Platform, you need to set up a basic development environment.  Choose a region based on your geographic location, and choose a name for your organization.  Don't worry about being perfect - you can change it or create new organizations later. Follow the **Create** link.
5. Now you need to name your first development space.  Again, this can be changed at any time.  After you've chosen a name, follow the **Create** link.
6. Follow the **I'm Ready** link to get started with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Platform.
7. Next up is ordering a new object storage service instance!

1. Login toÂ [https://console.bluemix.net/](https://console.bluemix.net/){: new_window}.
2. Navigate to the catalog, by clicking **Catalog** in the navigation bar.
3. Look for the **Cloud Object Storage** tile in the storage section and select it.
4. Give the service instance a name and choose either the lite or standard plan.
5. Click **Create** and you will be automatically redirected to your new instance.
