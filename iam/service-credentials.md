# Service credentials
A service credential provides the necessary information to connect an application to {{site.data.keyword.cos_short_notm}} packaged in a JSON document.  Service credentials are always associated with a Service ID, and new Service IDs can be created along with a new credential.  The credential contains the following values:

Field name | Value
--|--
`apikey`  |  New API key created for the Service ID
`endpoints`  |  Link to JSON representation of available endpoints
`iam_apikey_description`  |  API key description - initially autogenerated but editable
`iam_apikey_name`  |  API key name - initially autogenerated but editable
`iam_role_crn`  |  Unique identifier for the assigned role
`iam_serviceid_crn`  |  Unique identifier for the Service ID
`resource_instance_id`  |  Unique identifier for the instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_short_notm}} the credential will access

This is an example of a service credential:

```json
{
  "apikey": "0viPHOY7LbLNa9eLftrtHPpTjoGv6hbLD1QalRXikliJ",
  "endpoints": "https://cos-service.bluemix.net/endpoints",
  "iam_apikey_description": "Auto generated apikey during resource-key operation for Instance - crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/3ag0e9402tyfd5d29761c3e97696b71n:d6f74k03-6k4f-4a82-b165-697354o63903::",
  "iam_apikey_name": "auto-generated-apikey-f9274b63-ef0b-4b4e-a00b-b3bf9023f9dd",
  "iam_role_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Manager",
  "iam_serviceid_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/3ag0e9402tyfd5d29761c3e97696b71n::serviceid:ServiceId-540a4a41-7322-4fdd-a9e7-e0cb7ab760f9",
  "resource_instance_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/3ag0e9402tyfd5d29761c3e97696b71n:d6f74k03-6k4f-4a82-b165-697354o63903::"
}
```

## Using service credentials for single-bucket access
When a service credential is created, the underlying Service ID is granted a role on the entire instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_short_notm}}. If the intention that the credential be used to grant access to a subset of buckets and not the entire instance, this policy will need to be edited.  See the [Bucket permissions](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/buckets.html) page for more details.
